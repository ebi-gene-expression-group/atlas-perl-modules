Experiment Description	Dataset aims to uncover beneficial mutations on yeast strains (CEN.PK 113-11D based) engineered for polyamine over-production. We observed substantial heterogeneity between colony sizes and polyamine titers obtained between parent and final strains. Further physiological characterization of re-streaked colonies confirmed this phenotype, meaning that the sudden heterogeneity is heritable. Sequencing data presented here is used for identification differences between these mutated and parental strains.

Protocol Description	Clones of strains were cultivated overnight in 15 mL of Delft medium added with 40 mg/l uracil up to an OD600 around two.	Sequencing was performed with the NextSeq (High output kit) with 2 × 150 paired-end reads targeting a genome coverage of 100x per sample.	DNA libraries were prepared using a Kapa Hyper Prep Library Prep Kit (Roche Molecular Systems).	The Blood & Cell Culture DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) was used to extract genomic DNA from the overnight yeast culture using the protocol recommended by the manufacturer.
